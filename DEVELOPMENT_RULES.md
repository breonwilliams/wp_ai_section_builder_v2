# üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Incremental Development Only

### The Golden Rule
**Never write more than 100-200 lines of code without user testing.**

### What Went Wrong Before
1. **Built entire editor without testing basics** ‚ùå
2. **Used iframe approach (incompatible with drag-drop)** ‚ùå
3. **Created 13 sections before testing one** ‚ùå
4. **Mixed jQuery and native JS incorrectly** ‚ùå
5. **No incremental validation** ‚ùå
6. **Made assumptions about complex features** ‚ùå

### Development Phases (STRICT ORDER)

#### Phase 1: Foundation (TEST BEFORE PROCEEDING)
- [ ] Basic plugin activation
- [ ] ONE section type (Hero only)
- [ ] Simple admin form to add section
- [ ] Save to database
- [ ] Render on frontend
- [ ] **STOP - USER MUST TEST THIS**

#### Phase 2: Expand Minimally (TEST BEFORE PROCEEDING)
- [ ] Add ONE more section type
- [ ] Basic section management (list view)
- [ ] Edit existing sections
- [ ] **STOP - USER MUST TEST THIS**

#### Phase 3: Basic Management (TEST BEFORE PROCEEDING)
- [ ] Section reordering (simple up/down buttons)
- [ ] Delete sections
- [ ] Duplicate sections
- [ ] **STOP - USER MUST TEST THIS**

#### Phase 4: Settings (TEST BEFORE PROCEEDING)
- [ ] Basic section settings panel
- [ ] Global page settings
- [ ] Theme integration
- [ ] **STOP - USER MUST TEST THIS**

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features (ONLY IF ALL ABOVE WORKS)
- [ ] Consider drag-drop interface
- [ ] Consider AI integration
- [ ] Additional section types

### Implementation Rules

#### JavaScript Rules
1. **Use jQuery consistently** - No mixing with native DOM API
2. **Test every function individually**
3. **Use WordPress standards** (wp.hooks, wp.ajax)
4. **No complex state management initially**

#### PHP Rules
1. **Follow WordPress coding standards**
2. **Use WordPress APIs** (Settings API, Meta API)
3. **Proper nonce verification**
4. **Capability checks everywhere**

#### Architecture Rules
1. **Simple procedural code first**
2. **No complex OOP patterns until basics work**
3. **Database schema must be simple and tested**
4. **No service containers until justified**

#### Testing Rules
1. **Test on clean WordPress install**
2. **Test with default theme (Twenty Twenty-Four)**
3. **Test with one popular theme (Astra or GeneratePress)**
4. **User must verify every feature works as expected**

### Red Flags - STOP DEVELOPMENT IF:
- ‚õî Any JavaScript errors in console
- ‚õî Any PHP errors or warnings
- ‚õî Feature doesn't work as user expects
- ‚õî Database queries fail
- ‚õî Frontend doesn't render properly

### The Right Way Forward
1. ‚úÖ Start with absolute minimum viable product
2. ‚úÖ Test every single step with user
3. ‚úÖ User validates before proceeding to next phase
4. ‚úÖ Use only proven, simple patterns
5. ‚úÖ No assumptions - verify everything works

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Why This Approach
- Prevents building on broken foundations
- Ensures every feature actually works
- Allows course correction early
- Builds user confidence in the product

### Success Metrics
- User can successfully test each phase
- No JavaScript console errors
- No PHP errors in WordPress debug log
- Features work as expected by user
- Code is maintainable and expandable

**Remember: A simple plugin that works is infinitely better than a complex one that doesn't.**
